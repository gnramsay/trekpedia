# Trekpedia

Star Trek TV/Film episode database scraped from web sources, with a Django-based
Backend API and a React Frontend. This is a work in progress which will follow
the path `Scraper` -> `Backend` -> `Frontend`.

## Development

First development of the scraper is being carried out using Jupyter Notebooks.
These can be found in the 'notebooks' folder under the `backend` folder.

### Current progress

1. `trekpedia-stage-1.ipynb` : [COMPLETE] scrape the main Wikipedia Star Trek page and
  create a json file containing Series names and metadata(number of seasons,
  number of episodes etc.) This metadata will probably include series summary
  and other data in future iterations (not necessarily from Wikipedia)
2. `trekpedia-stage-2.ipynb` : [`IN PROGRESS`] Dump the episode names for each
  series to a separate json file.

## Installation

To Write as code progresses.
